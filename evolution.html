        FACTS ABOUT EVOLUTION
    </h1>
    <p>
    Some snakes have hipbones, which shows they once had four legs like lizards, their close cousins.
     </p>
     <p>
     Bears, seals, and dogs are closely related carnivores but are on a different branch of the evolutionary tree than cats and hyenas.
      </p>
      <p> 
      A panda's thumb is a wrist bone that elongated with evolution.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
      Most people had brown eyes until about 10,000 years ago when a single genetic mutation from the Black Sea switched the eyes from brown to blue. Approximately 8% of the world‚Äôs population now has blue eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
      Evolution rarely follows a straight line from species to species. Instead, it is more like a tree with many branches. Some branches lead to new branches, while others become dead ends.

      <p>
      Birds evolved from dinosaurs and both are descended from reptiles. The closest living reptilian relation of a bird is the crocodile.

      Inside some whales and dolphins are small bones that show they once had back legs and that their ancestors walked on land. These occasionally reappear as tiny rear flippers.

      <p>
      The term ‚Äúevolution‚Äù dates from the Latin evolutionem, meaning ‚Äúunrolling‚Äù or ‚Äúan opening of what was rolled up.‚Äù

      <p>
      Researchers believe that goose bumps are a remnant of thick hair that covered early humans.
      </p>
      <p>
      Evidence for evolution is continually being gathered and tested; consequently, scientists argue that evolution is both a fact and a theory.
      </p>
      <p>
      Many people feel the urge to lift their feet or climb to a more elevated position when scared or feeling anxious. Evolutionary biologists claim this is a remnant instinct from when early ground-dwelling mammals would climb trees when threatened.
      </p>
      <p>
      Historically, men prefer women with an hourglass figure. Researchers believe this is a product of evolution because the waist-hip ratio (WHR) serves as an indicator of reproductive health.
